Welcome to my GitHub portfolio.  I've selected a few Repositories that highlight work I've done.  The table indicates which technical skills comprise each project.  Each project and skill combination has a bar ranking from zero (blank) to 3 (max rank).  A rank of 3 indicates that skill is highly utilized, while a blank cell indicates that skill is not utilized in that project.
